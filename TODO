[DONE] Create a simple backend (FastAPI) with retry logic
[DONE] Test both Lambda and Kubernetes with it

[x] Cold start problem (How to mitigate this??)
[x] Improve the cost calculation to be accurate

[Done] Metrics gathering using prometheus for kubernetes, backend -- failures and success

[x] Can't implement the prometheus -- will need cloudwatch metrics

[x] Make the k8s adn lambda requests -- async, The lambda attempt logic is blocking request to kubernetes
